# Data Mining 2
Repository for "Data Mining - Advanced Topics and Applications" project exam.

This project consists in analysing and processing audio signals, employing advanced data mining/machine learning algorithms on the FMA dataset. 

This analysis is focused on:
- Imbalanced learning and anomaly detection;
- Advanced classification methods: Naive Bayes, Rule-based classifiers, Logistic Regression, SVM, Ensemble and Neural Netoworks (MLP);
- Time series analysis;
- Sequential Pattern Mining and Advanced Clustering: X-Means, OPTICS and Transactional Clustering;
- Application of ethic principles: Explaianbility;

## Module 1
