In this paper we propose a detailed analysis of the FMA-Archive-Music, which counts for 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 161 genres. 
The study will be focused on imbalanced learning, anomaly detection, advanced classification methods, time series analysis and sequential pattern mining.
For the proposed applications we experimented with many tasks ranging from binary and multi genre recognition, song popularity detection, years classification and last but not least songs'emotion recognition.
However due to pages constraint, we decided to include in details only few of those methods, while the others are described in a more general way.
Since we had a wide range of inter-changeable features we could employ (i.e. \textit{echonest.csv} and \textit{features.csv}), each method described the following section, was tested on both datasets, and only the one with the highest (most interesting) performance was included in the report.
The data are provided by the FMA-Archive, which is partitioned into 4 major datasets: \textit{tracks.csv, genres.csv, features.csv} and \textit{echonest.csv}.
